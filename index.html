      <h2>Long story short!</h2>
      <p>I was born in Portugal in 1986, but my journey is one that crosses borders in a search for knowledge. I have explored different fields of science and arts, from landscape design to nanotechnology, and I have a bachelor's degree in electronic
        engineer. I had the privilege to have a computer and internet access at a young age, and it fulled my passion for computers and artificial intelligence. I started to program in high school with C language, and that has given me the
        foundations of how computers work. At the university, I explored my passion for nature and arts for a while, returning to computers, but this time focusing on the physical properties that define a computer and computation. </p>
      <p>After acquiring my degree in electronic engineering, I got fascinated by the perspective that the brain can be interpreted as a computer that processes information from reality. I am currently on my last year of the Cognitive Science
        master’s degree at Lisbon University. My thesis is centered in the philosophical question, "Do beliefs hold a causal relation to the behavior of the body, or do the laws of physics eliminate the need for beliefs to explain the causal
        relations of behavior?" The goal for my future is to explore the bridge between computers and brains, not only has an analogy, but also as an extension of the mind in two different mediums.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left">CRITICAL THINKING</h3>
        <p>It is a great skill to be able to process information that is transmitted to us from other mental entities. Anything spoken or written is nothing more than some else's opinion, and we process information accordingly to our own set of
          beliefs. It is important that we have present which sub set of beliefs we are using to process any given information. We should be conscious that for as much confidence we have in something, it can be wrong. In an information sharing
          setting, each person should contribute with their opinion to persuade the other to change his set of beliefs. Since we can be wrong, it is import to be flexible and critic about one own set of beliefs.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: right">EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE</h3>
        <p>Our emotions are powerful resources that influence our behavior. This power can take control of our actions or be used as a guide for our decisions. It is important to be aware of our emotions, so we can understand what is causing that emotion. This allows the mind to decide where to spend the energy and invest the mental resources in actions that serve our goals. Mindfulness techniques are a great tool to train our mind on how to recognize our emotions. My mindfulness practices have taught me how to maintain clear focus in stressful situations, specially in situations where my emoticons of panic and fear kept informing me about the dangers and worries.</p>
